# Browsers

# Browsers

- A set of browsers is essential to each front-end developer (really?!)
- The mostly used are Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, MS Edge/IE, Apple Safari and Opera
  - Each has different layout engine for HTML, CSS and JS
- Each browser has their own development tools
  - Press **F12** to open it
  - Used for:
    - Debugging JS
    - Testing HTML/CSS
    - Etc..

# Virtual machines

- Every front-end developer needs a lot of browsers
  - And their different versions
    - IE 6, IE 7, IE 8, IE 9, IE 10, IE 11, Edge, ...
- Yet, some browsers have requirements
  - IE and Edge are available only on Windows
  - Safari is only available on Mac OS X
- How can one have all the browsers?
  - Virtual machines

# Virtual machines

- Example of VMs:
  - Host OS - Mac OS X (has Safari, Firefox and Chrome)
  - Guest Windows XP (for IE 6)
  - Second Guest Windows XP (for IE 7)
  - Guest Windows 7 (for IE 8)
  - Second Guest Windows 7 (for IE 9)
  - Guest Windows 10 (for Edge)

# Testing a web app on VMs

- The testing is done in the following steps:
  1.  Develop the app, using a random browser
    - Let's say Firefox
  2.  Test this app on all the browsers on the VMs
    - If the app fails for any browser, return to 1

# Testing a web app
- Very good, still...
- There are easier ways:
  - https://www.browserstack.com/
- Browser Stack provides all the VMs you need
  - Paid
  - Has a free trial
