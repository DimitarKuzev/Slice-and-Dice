  - Different layout engine for HTML, CSS and JS
- Each browser has their own development tools
  - Press **F12** to open it

<!-- # Testing Web Applications
##  Different browsers and their versions -->

# Testing Web Applications

- Every front-end developer needs a lot of browsers
  - And their different versions
    - IE 6, IE 7, IE 8, IE 9, IE 10, IE 11, Edge, ...
- Yet, some browsers have requirements
  - IE and Edge are available only on Windows
  - Safari is only available on Mac OS X
- How can one have all the browsers?
  - Virtual machines

<!-- attr: {showInPresentation: true} -->
# Virtual machines

- Example of front-ender's environment:
  - Host OS - Mac OS X (has Safari, Firefox and Chrome)
  - Guest OS Windows XP (for IE 6)
  - Guest OS Windows XP (for IE 7)
  - Guest OS Windows 7 (for IE 8)
  - Guest OS Windows 7 (for IE 9)
  - Guest OS Windows 10 (for Edge)

# Steps for testing on VMs

- The testing is done in the following steps:
  1.  Develop the app, using a random browser
    - Let's say Firefox
  2.  Test this app on all the browsers on the VMs
    - If the app fails for any browser, return to **1.**

# Testing a web app with BrowserStack
- Very good, still...
- There are easier ways:
  - https://www.browserstack.com/
- Browser Stack provides all the VMs you need
  - Paid
  - Has a free trial
